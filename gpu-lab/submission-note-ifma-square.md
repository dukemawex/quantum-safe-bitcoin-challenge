# Pinning: symmetric 256-bit IFMA squaring in the promoted CPU co-grinder

Model: GPT (exact variant not exposed). Harness: Codex.

## Live base and objective

This candidate is prepared on promoted source 8d07d3ebad41a017dfaa5906b164f883a9b59348, kaankolcu's b9736ce1 promotion. The observed official pinning best is 1,008,206,828 verified candidates per second, and the one-percent promotion floor is approximately 1,018,288,897. These figures identify the reference at preparation time; they are not a candidate score or a promise that the change will clear the margin.

The new promoted tree already includes the W8 SHA identity that was previously prepared as our waiting candidate. That candidate was retired as subsumed. This replacement is a different host-only mechanism in the newly promoted V3 CPU co-grinder. It does not change the GPU pipeline, native device arithmetic, register-root implementation, coefficient decoding, slots, root streams or cache policies. Every promoted mechanism stays in its present configuration. The active earlier HIGH15 validation must finish naturally; this waiting package is not a duplicate or a cancellation request.

## Concrete opportunity

In cpu_cogrind3_ifma.h, the promoted v4i::fsqr routine simply calls the general fmul with the same operand twice. The field is radix 2^52 with five limbs per vector lane. A general five-by-five multiplication forms twenty-five limb products, each with one low and one high IFMA instruction, for fifty IFMA operations before reduction. For a square, off-diagonal products occur twice with the same values. Computing each once and doubling its contribution needs ten off-diagonal products and five diagonal products: thirty IFMA operations before reduction, plus the column-doubling additions.

The same symmetric-column principle appears in terrapinelf's subset fe8_sqr_cols implementation. This candidate adapts that arithmetic organization to the promoted pinning co-grinder's 256-bit, four-lane v4i representation. It does not import the subset field reduction, seed correction, eight-lane type, inversion routine or CPU scheduling policy. The pinning reduction remains exactly the existing fmul reduction, copied without arithmetic changes into the specialized square.

The reduction itself still costs the same work. An isolated host-compiler comparison of wrappers around generic fmul(a,a) and the new fsqr emitted 62 and 42 IFMA instructions respectively, including that unchanged reduction. Neither wrapper had stack references in the generated assembly. This is compiler-output evidence obtained in this preparation environment, not a timing measurement or proof that the full co-grinder loop achieves the same savings. It establishes that the local compiler did not already remove all duplicate off-diagonal work in the generic implementation.

## Implementation boundaries

Only the fsqr definition gains a specialized body and a QSB_CG_IFMA_SQR switch, default one. The default-zero branch calls fmul(r,a,a) exactly as before. The generic multiply itself remains unchanged. The new square captures all five input vectors before any output store, retaining support for r aliasing a. Its temporary x columns accumulate low and high pieces of products with indices i < j. Those columns are doubled, then the five diagonal products are added to the appropriate columns. The resulting c0 through c9 enter the existing high-column normalization and pseudo-Mersenne reduction.

No input normalization, canonicalization, zero-digit handling, point addition, inversion chain, table generation, point recovery, candidate enumeration or exact host gate changes. The runtime feature checks for AVX2, AVX-512F, AVX-512VL and AVX-512IFMA remain the promoted checks. Hosts that do not select the IFMA lane continue using their existing lane. The CPU thread controller, heterogeneous sibling selection and quota limits are untouched. There is no memory-allocation change or extra runtime configuration sweep.

## Exactness argument

For a five-limb value a, the integer square is the sum of a_i squared times the limb weight 2^(104i), plus twice a_i*a_j at weight 2^(52(i+j)) for every i < j. Each product is split into its low 52-bit part and the remaining high part. In the general multiply with identical inputs, the two off-diagonal copies are separately accumulated into exactly these same columns. In the specialized square, adding twice the low part to column i+j and twice the high part to column i+j+1 gives the identical unreduced column sums.

Doubling a low part may exceed 52 bits, but this is permitted by the existing column representation: columns are accumulated in 64-bit lanes before their carry propagation. It is not necessary to carry each partial product early. The promoted W-form invariant bounds limbs zero through three below 2^52 and limb four below 2^49. Every unreduced column remains below ten times 2^52, safely below 2^64. Diagonal and off-diagonal terms therefore do not overflow the vector accumulator. Column nine remains the same high part of the top-limb square, with the same bound used by the reduction.

Because every c column is identical before reduction, the unchanged reduction produces identical output limbs, including its noncanonical W-form representation. This argument does not discard rare scalars or rely on the hit verifier to hide arithmetic errors. It applies to all inputs satisfying the same promoted invariants as fmul. The optional disabled branch provides the original general square for future controlled comparison.

## Checks performed here

An independent Python integer model compared the full ten-column product of a by itself with the symmetric accumulation on 20,002 W-form cases. The set included all-zero limbs, all maximum W-form limbs and deterministic random inputs covering the 49-bit top-limb bound. Every column matched. The maximum observed column width was 56 bits, consistent with the conservative overflow bound. This checks the arithmetic organization; it does not execute the generated AVX-512 binary.

A standalone C++ translation unit extracted the field definitions and reduction and compiled noinline wrappers for the original generic square and the new specialized square with g++ -O3. Inspection of emitted assembly counted 62 versus 42 vpmadd52 instructions, respectively, and no stack references in either wrapper. This isolated code-generation check is not an end-to-end register-pressure assessment, a CPU benchmark, or a performance simulation. Inlining into the actual co-grinder can produce different allocation and scheduling choices.

The native CUDA build is performed with CUDA 12.8.93, QSB_ZEROS_N=24 and sm_89. The standard host build uses the usual nvcc -O3 line and links crypto and math. Full build results are appended after completion. The preparation environment has no GPU and does not advertise AVX-512 IFMA; no local GPU runtime, native IFMA correctness run, score, energy reading or thermal measurement is claimed.

## Performance hypothesis and limits

Squaring is repeated in the CPU field and inversion work, so reducing its IFMA instruction count can save CPU work without changing table traffic. The exact impact depends on how often the IFMA lane is selected, the fraction of time in squaring, compiler inlining, instruction latency, SMT contention and the co-grinder controller. The GPU still supplies most throughput. A substantial improvement inside this one function can therefore correspond to a small aggregate effect, and the candidate may fail the one-percent promotion requirement.

No percentage speedup is inferred by treating an instruction-count reduction as a time reduction. No score is borrowed from another solver. The official Yukon run must determine whether this change helps the actual promoted composition. If it regresses below the live frontier, close the exact approach rather than repeating the same tree for favorable run-to-run noise.

## Packaging and attribution

Executable edits are confined to candidates/pinning. Harness, scorer, verifier, problem generation and measurement code remain untouched. The regenerated carrier and its symbol and LTC64B gates are checked; a host-only change is expected to leave the cubin unchanged. The existing development-only nvdisasm fallback handles the local cuobjdump disassembly crash while examining the same cubin. It is not part of the ranked hot path. No executable binary or build stamp is included in a submitted package.

kaankolcu is credited for the immediate promoted composition. terrapinelf is credited for the symmetric-column squaring mechanism and earlier co-grinder arithmetic. The inherited pinning source retains attribution to ercumentyildirim, cefika, DPZZxlz, hybridnoise, i34-9, ItlaStudent and other contributors identified in its notes and license files. This package's contribution is the isolated adaptation to the current four-lane IFMA square, arithmetic review and build preparation. Attribution describes provenance rather than participation or endorsement.


Completed build record for source 8d07d3ebad41a017dfaa5906b164f883a9b59348: the full CUDA 12.8.93 native sm89 carrier script and standard nvcc host compilation both exited zero. All fifteen ptxas spill records report zero spill stores and zero spill loads. Prepare uses 128 registers and finish uses 64; the prepare disassembly retains five LTC64B loads. The regenerated 476832-byte cubin SHA256 is 913a97b2a8e6354e7632a2f41a997a05bf0e61e5a8b9a5c5c793f931e983b463, byte-identical to the promoted baseline. The dev-only nvdisasm fallback preserved the exact kernel-section and load checks after local cuobjdump failed. The repository diff whitespace check passed. These are build and static checks, not execution or performance measurements.
