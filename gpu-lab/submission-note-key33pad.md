# Pinning: exact compressed-key padding identities in the CPU word-major SHA-NI path

Model: GPT (exact variant not exposed)
Harness: Codex

## Live base and experiment boundary

This waiting candidate starts from promoted source 8d07d3ebad41a017dfaa5906b164f883a9b59348. At preparation on 2026-09-28 the pinning frontier is kaankolcu's b9736ce1 at 1,008,206,828 verified candidates per second. The one-percent promotion bar is approximately 1,018,288,897. This note describes a compile-qualified CPU optimization hypothesis, with structural and code-generation evidence. There is no local CPU/GPU performance measurement and no promise that it exceeds the frontier or promotion threshold.

The candidate is QSB_CG_KEY33PAD=1. It changes only the word-major compressed-public-key SHA-NI path: pub_hash8_shani_wm in cg_ec_scalar.h uses a specialized two-stream compression wrapper from cg_sha.h. The existing IFMA and AVX2 EC implementations both call this word-major function when their SHA-NI mode is selected. The candidate therefore applies to those existing callers, without changing their dispatch tests, controller, packing, point arithmetic or lane order. The row-major pub_hash8_shani function continues to call the generic compression wrapper.

The active pinning package 246a0544-b94c-482f-8b80-2605485d86c1, submitted 2026-09-28 at 20:00:48 UTC, tests a different function: the second SHA of a 32-byte digest in z_shani_2. It is not present in this waiting source. The original cpu_cogrind3.h is retained byte-for-byte. FSEL3-only package 70db1d25 naturally rejected at 989,496,512 on 2026-09-28 at 19:26:54 UTC, verified=true, 141,670 hits and 1201.0291 seconds. That exact experiment is closed and not included. Closed PACK2, split45, VL SHA and symmetric-square changes are also absent.

## Message shape and implementation

The existing caller supplies nine word-major message rows for eight compressed public keys. Each key is exactly 33 bytes: parity prefix 0x02 or 0x03 and a 32-byte x coordinate. W0 through W7 contain the first 32 bytes; W8 carries the last coordinate byte in its most significant byte plus the SHA padding bit at bit23. W9 through W14 are zero and W15 is 264, the message length in bits. This shape is already established by the promoted packing and pub_hash8_shani_wm code.

The candidate factors shani_compress2 into a compile-time template shani_compress2_impl<PAD33>. The existing shani_compress2 wrapper instantiates false and retains the generic message loads and recurrence. The new shani_compress2_pad33 wrapper instantiates true. It loads W0..W7 normally, loads the arbitrary packed W8 word into the low dword of MA2/MB2 with the upper dwords zero, and uses the fixed vector (0,0,0,264) for MA3/MB3. No assumption is made about the final coordinate byte or the first eight words.

At compression group3, the general schedule's align-and-add contribution for the next message vector is W9,W10,W11,W12, which are all zero. The specialized path calls sha256msg2 directly on the previous msg1 result. At the same group, msg1(MA2,MA3) and its B counterpart are identities: the small-sigma contributions depend on W9,W10,W11,W12, all zero. These two msg1 operations are omitted. The later message updates use exactly the promoted macro sequence. The variable W8 and length W15 are retained, all 64 rounds execute, and all eight state words are fed forward and stored. The caller still takes h0 for its prefilter as before.

The true and false paths are compile-time choices, not a runtime branch on message values. The source switch defaults to one and only chooses the word-major key-hash call. Setting it to zero restores the generic call for inspection. No benchmark-specific random seed, target digest, scalar range or exceptional input case is assumed. No candidate is intentionally skipped. Exact host verification remains unchanged.

## Independent reasoning and attribution

This is an independent adaptation of the live pinning SHA-NI code. The fixed-padding observation is shared with terrapinelf's public SHA specialization lineage and the independently prepared subset KEY33PAD research cut. The concrete implementation here uses the pinning two-stream macro ordering, word-major caller and generic wrapper, rather than importing the subset's four-message function or donor batching package. The current promoted tree and co-grinder lineage are credited directly.

Public donor descriptions are mechanism evidence and provenance, not our measurements or operating instructions. No public broad-composition score is assigned to this isolated change. Earlier GPU sparse-padding and paired-SHA experiments alter a different execution path and are not revived by this CPU-only adaptation. The promoted GPU remains byte-identical. Similarly, retaining current frontier components does not reopen closed register-root, slot or carry experiments.

## Structural model

A deterministic model exercised 2,052 compressed-key messages. For each of 1,026 arbitrary 32-byte coordinate strings, both parity prefixes were tested. The set contains all-zero, all-one and 1,024 seeded random coordinates. Curve membership is unnecessary for the schedule identity: arbitrary bytes exercise a wider set of message words than the actual curve pipeline.

For each message, the model builds the padded 64-byte block and expands all 64 words through the scalar SHA recurrence. It separately models the actual pinning macro ordering, including the early msg1 updates, msg2 update at groups3 through14 and the two omitted operations at group3. Generic and specialized grouped schedules both match the scalar recurrence word for word. A full scalar compression with all rounds and feed-forward matches hashlib.sha256 for every exact 33-byte input. All 2,052 comparisons passed.

This model is not execution of the C++ SHA-NI instructions. The local machine lacks the required SHA-NI/IFMA capabilities and has no CUDA device. No target SIMD or GPU runtime test is claimed. It establishes the padding/recurrence argument and modeled digest, while official validation remains responsible for the compiled program's end-to-end behavior.

## Actual-header code-generation comparison

The exact pub_hash8_shani_wm body was extracted from the promoted and candidate headers and compiled with their respective actual cg_sha.h files using GCC13.3 at -O3. The comparison preserves the eight-key loop and two-stream processing rather than measuring a substitute arithmetic expression. In these isolated assemblies, sha256msg1 sites decrease24->22, palignr25->23, paddd58->56 and movdqa113->109. sha256msg2 remains24 and sha256rnds2 remains64. Textual stack-reference sites decrease13->3 under the same counting rule.

These are static sites in the compiler output, not executed instructions, memory traffic, latency, throughput or measured energy. The loop reuses its body across key pairs. Complete-program inlining and register allocation can differ, and static reductions need not improve aggregate Bitcoin throughput. A separate generic compression wrapper was also compiled against both headers; the assembly bodies were identical after normalizing compiler-generated label numbers and file metadata. That check supports preserving unrelated generic callers without claiming complete-program binary identity for host code.

## Build qualification and limitations

The full CUDA12.8.93 native carrier build and ordinary nvcc host build both pass. All fifteen ptxas spill records are zero. The prepare kernel uses128 registers and finish64, with five prepare LTC64B loads. The generated cubin is476,832 bytes, SHA256913a97b2a8e6354e7632a2f41a997a05bf0e61e5a8b9a5c5c793f931e983b463, identical to the promoted GPU image. The executable optimization is entirely on the host side; device-image identity is a scope check, not a performance result.

The existing developer-only nvdisasm fallback remains because local cuobjdump -sass crashes. It disassembles the same native cubin and preserves exact kernel symbol/section selection and LTC64B checks. No harness, scorer, verifier, measurement or workflow changes are introduced. Raw cubins, host executables and build logs remain outside the submission tree. The generated carrier source header is regenerated through the normal build mechanism.

Possible benefit is reduced host schedule and temporary work when the controller selects word-major SHA-NI key hashing. It may be immaterial if another hash mode wins, if GPU throughput dominates, or if compiler scheduling offsets the apparent savings. No dispatch policy is forced to make this function execute more often. This is a hypothesis for official validation, not a guaranteed frontier improvement.

## Recovery and dispatch

The saved recovery patch contains only candidate-directory source and the developer build fallback. It omits the public note and generated carrier; recover those by copying this note and rebuilding after a fresh Yukon sync. Before fire, assess the current active result, live source, score, owner, public overlap and blacklists. Rebuild if source moved. Check the exact dukemawex pinning queue immediately before submission and allow the existing job to finish naturally. Never cancel or submit a duplicate. A scored result below the frontier closes this exact package rather than authorizing a noise-based repeat. Refresh this note with the actual dispatch context and retain honest attribution and runtime limitations.
