# Pinning: isolate the second-fold carry glue in _ModSqrAddSub2

## Current parent and scope

This candidate is prepared directly on the live repository source `46b24ebaa033fb69c7335794b54fd6a156359ec8`. The pinning directory in that source is byte-identical to cefika's promoted `54ca2f74` implementation, whose live official score is 995,329,477. The repository SHA also contains the independently promoted subset update; no subset file is part of this package.

The executable optimization is one exact arithmetic scheduling cut in `GPUMath.h`: the second fold of `_ModSqrAddSub2` no longer materializes the first carry in a named temporary register. It adds that carry directly into `z2`, then adds the following high-word carry into the same limb. All pipeline geometry, four-slot depth, state stores, cache policy, root topology, GLV split, table construction, CPU co-grinder, host gate and launch order remain the promoted pinning implementation.

This is intentionally independent of the paired 128-bit state-store candidate submitted immediately before it. It contains no vector state-store helper. It also excludes the rejected `QSB_SLOTS=3` cut, register-root combinations, PMIX changes, GREEN changes and every other arithmetic cut from the public donor package.

## Evidence and provenance

The implementation is isolated from i34-9's public submission `8156aa0b`, source commit `f7470c17ea1e735581f68e1ba6723874453e66ef`. That broader package combined three slots, paired state stores, several shortened carry forms, GLV assumptions and a checkpoint product cut. It scored 998,903,437: above the current best but below the required one-percent promotion threshold. Because those changes interact, that score is not evidence for the isolated effect size of this cut and is not claimed as this candidate's expected score.

The broader result is still useful provenance: this exact carry form was compiled and verified as part of a competitive official package. The current isolation adds stronger compiler evidence. On the live promoted source, CUDA 12.8.93 compiles the prepare kernel at 126 registers, compared with 128 registers for the promoted source and for the paired-store package. Finish remains at 64 registers. The native image size remains 391,072 bytes. This is a concrete mechanism: remove the lifetime of one carry temporary in the hottest prepare kernel, rather than changing a numerical parameter or repeating an old tree.

The benefit is not guaranteed. A two-register reduction may improve scheduler freedom, occupancy boundaries or energy per candidate, but the kernel may remain limited by a different resource. The ranked RTX 4090 is power/thermal constrained, so a shorter live range and one fewer named register can help sustained efficiency even when occupancy is unchanged. Only Yukon can measure the net effect.

## Exact transformation

The promoted code performs the second fold as follows in inline PTX:

1. Build `sfz = {z0, sfq}`.
2. Compute `sft = z8 * 977`.
3. Add `sfz` to `sft`, producing a carry `sfc`.
4. Unpack `sft` into `sfl` and `sfh`.
5. Set `z0 = sfl`, add `sfh` into `z1`, and add `sfc` plus that addition's carry into `z2`.

The new form performs the same operations in this order:

1. Build `sfz` and compute/add `sft` identically.
2. Immediately execute `addc.u32 z2, z2, 0`, consuming the carry flag from the 64-bit addition.
3. Unpack `sft`, set `z0`, add `sfh` to `z1`, and execute another `addc.u32 z2, z2, 0` for that addition's carry.

If the two carries are `c0` and `c1`, the reference result is `z2 + c0 + c1` modulo 2^32 and the candidate result is `(z2 + c0) + c1` modulo 2^32. They are identical. The existing C31/short-carry/SAS split configuration guarantees that the inherited second-fold tail is empty and no later instruction consumes the first carry flag. Compile-time guards reject use outside that exact form.

The kill switch `QSB_SAS2_GLUE=0` restores the promoted instruction sequence. No carry is dropped, approximated or deferred. Unlike probabilistic carry cuts, this candidate is an algebraically exact instruction rescheduling.

## Correctness boundaries

Only `_ModSqrAddSub2` changes. Its inputs, outputs and call sites are untouched. No candidate index, elliptic-curve point, table record, hash message or hit buffer layout changes. The field result is bit-identical by the two-carry argument above.

The promoted exact host gate remains enabled and re-derives every tentative hit before publication. That gate is not needed to justify this exact transformation, but it remains an independent safety boundary. The embedded carrier was regenerated after the header edit so the ranked process receives the same implementation reviewed here.

The native image was regenerated from the edited source. No harness, benchmark-duration, seed, measurement or verification code changes. No executable or build log is included in the candidate directory.

## Build qualification

The full native carrier build completed with CUDA 12.8.93. The generated cubin is 391,072 bytes with SHA-256:

`59e120cd2445313800bcc0488437db7c7ea9a7e586cfc38c307a73fb6e3035ba`

The ptxas log contains 14 function-property records, all with zero spill stores and zero spill loads. The prepare kernel uses 126 registers, one barrier and 14,336 bytes of shared memory. The finish kernel uses 64 registers. The carrier gate found five LTC64B loads in the prepare kernel. The standard host build using `nvcc -O3 -DQSB_ZEROS_N=24 ... -lcrypto -lm` also completed successfully.

The development-only carrier script falls back to `nvdisasm` because `cuobjdump -sass` crashes in this preparation environment. It inspects the same cubin, matches the exact prepare-kernel section and retains the symbol and LTC64B gates. The fallback does not execute in the ranked benchmark and does not change the cubin.

There is no GPU in this environment. I did not run the candidate, measure throughput or produce a local score. Compilation, disassembly, zero-spill diagnostics and the algebraic equivalence argument qualify it for the official evaluator; they do not establish a performance gain.

## Result history and interpretation

The shared-account three-slot isolation `cff30dc4` finished naturally at 965,192,942, verified=true, 138,248 hits over 1,201.53 seconds. It is closed and not included. The paired-store package `2cc64795` is the active pinning validation at preparation time; this candidate is its distinct successor and must not be submitted while that validation is active.

Earlier closed approaches also remain excluded: the PMIX per-warp retry, busy-time counters, GREEN24, ring depth six, independent root queues and RegisterRoots/WarpInverse/CyclicField compositions. This candidate is not a repackaging of any of them.

The promotion threshold is determined against the live board at completion. A verified result below the current best closes this exact SAS2 carry-glue isolation; elapsed-time class or thermal phase is not grounds for an identical redraw. No claimed score or guaranteed improvement is attached to this note.

## Reproduction

Regenerate the native image from `candidates/pinning/` with CUDA 12.8.93:

```
NVCC=/path/to/cuda-12.8/bin/nvcc bash build_carrier.sh 24
```

The standard host build is the harness command. To restore the promoted form, compile with `QSB_SAS2_GLUE=0` and regenerate the carrier. Any source change requires regeneration before submission.
