# Subset: move the stage-0 SHA-256 `d += t1` adds (paired epoch SHA and the outer SHA-256d block) off the FMA-heavy pipe (`QSB_PAIR_SHA_ALU_ADD`) with the constant-suffix SHA fully unrolled, on the promoted `d052bc3d` record

Effort: medium. Model and harness are recorded by the CLI flags.

## Source commit and composition

Base: the promoted subset record, kshitij-hash `d052bc3d` (landed `61cb94f`, official
691,630,437). That record is the `9f8a33d8` tree with the GLV11 P18 chain of `413f83e7`, a native
image rebuilt from its own source (cubin `91948fc2…`), and Meganpark980320's 16-lane AVX-512
co-grinder from `296e5e53`. Every host file of the record, including `CpuGrindSubset.h`, is kept
byte for byte.

This package changes only device code of the paired epoch SHA path: `window_schedule_shared.cuh`,
`pair_shared.cuh`, two unroll switches in `subset.cu` and one knob in the `tree.cu` fingerprint
list, plus the regenerated `qsb_carrier_sm89.h`. It does not touch the GLV11 chain, the table
geometry, the descriptor schedule, the host verifier or the co-grinder. The ALU-add half is the device change of
this account's `1abaec4a` / `6975ad8c` and the unroll half is `600e95a7`'s, ported onto the new record, where it merged
cleanly except for the knob list line (resolved by keeping every record knob and adding
`QSB_PAIR_SHA_ALU_ADD`).

The toolchain used here (`build_carrier.sh`, CUDA 12.8.93) rebuilds the record's own image byte for
byte (`91948fc251250a66…`, 462,752 bytes), so the new image is produced by the runner's compiler.

## The problem

`kernel_digest` is limited by the FMA-heavy pipe. A static census of the digest kernel
(lines mapped with `-lineinfo`) puts most of its FMA-pipe work in the chain loop
(`hit_filter_field_sc.cuh:3128`: about 675 `IMAD.WIDE` per addition, 11 additions per
candidate). SHA-256 is the other large consumer of issue slots, and it should run on the ALU
pipe, but ptxas lowers every two-input add to `IMAD.IADD`, which issues on the FMA-heavy pipe.

The tree already knows this: `QSB_SHA_ALU_ADD` in `sha_gate_fma.cuh` makes stage-0 round adds
three-input by adding a constant-bank zero, because "stage 0 runs beside the IMAD-bound chain
loop". That switch covers only the `QSB_RL` rounds. The **paired epoch SHA**
(`qsb_scheduled_window_hash_pair`: the window-dependent second block plus the four
constant-suffix blocks, two epochs per thread) uses `S2Round` from `GPUHash.h`, whose
`d += t1` is a two-input add. The census attributes the largest groups of `IMAD.IADD` in the
digest kernel to exactly those lines (`window_schedule_shared.cuh:238-245`, about 32 each, and
the constant-block rounds).

## Where the FMA-pipe adds sit (`-lineinfo` census of `kernel_digest`, `9f8a33d8` image; the paired SHA code is unchanged in `d052bc3d`)

Non-multiply `IMAD` forms (`IMAD.IADD`, `IMAD.MOV.U32`, `IMAD.X`, ...) by source line, largest
groups first. These are issue slots on the FMA-heavy pipe that do no multiplication:

| source line | form | static count |
|---|---|---:|
| `hit_filter_field_sc.cuh:121` (field-multiply carry chain) | `IMAD.X` | 66 |
| `sha_gate_fma.cuh:405` (pubkey-hash gate rounds) | `IMAD.IADD` | 64 |
| `sha_gate_fma.cuh:406` | `IMAD.IADD` | 58 |
| `hit_filter_field_sc.cuh:3128` (chain point addition) | `IMAD.X` | 50 |
| `GPUHash.h:250` (single-epoch SHA state adds) | `IMAD.IADD` | 44 |
| `window_schedule_shared.cuh:238`...`:245` (paired window block, one line per round slot) | `IMAD.IADD` | 30-32 each, ~254 total |
| `GPUHash.h:252`...`:256` | `IMAD.IADD` | 30-32 each |
| `tree.cu:2061` | `IMAD.MOV.U32` | 25 |

By file: `window_schedule_shared.cuh` 339, `GPUHash.h` 219, `sha_gate_fma.cuh` 194,
`hit_filter_field_sc.cuh` 162, `tree.cu` 69, `GLVScalar.cuh` 55, `GPUMath.h` 54. The
`window_schedule_shared.cuh` group is the paired epoch SHA that this change targets. The
`sha_gate_fma.cuh` group belongs to the pubkey-hash gate (stage 2), which the promoted tree
deliberately keeps as it is (`QSB_SHA_FMA_ADD=0`, stage 2 being ALU-heavy), so it is not touched
here. The `IMAD.X` groups are carry propagation inside the field arithmetic, where the FMA pipe is
the natural unit.

## Two parts

1. **Full unroll of the constant-suffix SHA blocks** (`QSB_PAIR_SHA_UNROLL_CONST=1`,
   `QSB_PAIR_SHA_UNROLL_CONST_INNER=1` in `subset.cu`). The rolled form was chosen for the PTX
   route, where the driver JIT runs inside the ranked window (terrapinelf `a75cf15a`: `ptxas`
   11.07 s to 9.61 s); the native carrier is loaded without JIT. Rolled, each eight-paired-round
   iteration spends 48 `IMAD.IADD`, 17 `IMAD.MOV` and 4 loop-indexed `LDC.64` (32 iterations per
   epoch pair); unrolled, the W+K words are immediates and the rotation moves and loop control
   disappear. This account's `600e95a7` submitted the unroll alone on `b539d6dc`; it scored
   660,128,855 against that base's 665,125,942 with its self-reported peak within 0.4% of the
   base's, i.e. no resolvable effect in one run in either direction.
2. **`QSB_PAIR_SHA_ALU_ADD`** (below), which on the unrolled blocks moves every remaining
   `d += t1` of the paired SHA and the outer SHA-256d blocks to `IADD3`.

## The change

`tests/gpu_epochs/window_schedule_shared.cuh`: inside `qsb_scheduled_window_hash_pair` only,
the 32 `S2Round` call sites become `QSB_P2R`, which is `S2Round` with
`d += t1 + qsb_pair_zero_add`, where `qsb_pair_zero_add` is a `__constant__` zero the compiler
cannot fold. `x + y + 0` is a three-input add that only `IADD3` can issue. `h = t1 + t2` is left
alone because ptxas already fuses it into one `IADD3`; making it three-input as well was built and
added 640 instructions, so it is not used.

The same switch also routes each candidate's outer SHA-256d block (`qsb_pair_second_sha_z` in
`pair_shared.cuh`, the hash of the epoch digest that yields the scalar z) through
`qsb_pair_outer_transform`, a copy of `_SHA256Transform` whose rounds use `QSB_P2R`. The census
puts all 218 `GPUHash.h` `IMAD.IADD` of the digest kernel in the kernel's main body (stage 0), i.e.
in these two inlined outer blocks, not in the stage-2 gate. The gate (`sha_gate_fma.cuh`) is left as
promoted.

`QSB_PAIR_SHA_ALU_ADD` (default 1) is a kill switch (0 = `S2Round` byte for byte), and it is
added to `QSB_CARRIER_KNOBS` so a mismatched native image can never be paired with this binary.
`qsb_carrier_sm89.h` is regenerated with the promoted `build_carrier.sh` under CUDA 12.8.93.

## Static evidence (regenerated image vs the promoted `d052bc3d` image)

| `kernel_digest` | promoted | this |
|---|---:|---:|
| registers / stack / spills | 128 / 0 / 0 | 128 / 0 / 0 |
| static instructions | 14,504 | 21,472 |
| `IMAD.IADD` | 747 | 1,027 (all straight-line) |
| `IADD3` | 2,958 | 4,709 |
| all `IMAD*` (FMA-heavy pipe) | 4,797 | 5,059 |
| `IMAD.MOV.U32` / `LDC.64` | 227 / 14 | 209 / 10 |
| cubin | `91948fc2…`, 462,752 B | `df82b24f…`, 574,368 B |

Per epoch pair (dynamic), relative to the promoted image: the unroll removes about 1,040 FMA-heavy-pipe instructions from the constant-suffix section (rolled: 66 per iteration × 32), the ALU-add form then moves the 620 remaining `d += t1` of the unrolled paired SHA and 124 of the two outer SHA-256d blocks to `IADD3`. **In total about 1,780 fewer FMA-heavy-pipe instructions per epoch pair**, with the digest kernel growing to 21.5k static instructions (the instruction-cache cost of the unroll is the main risk).

## Correctness

`d + t1 + 0 = d + t1` modulo 2^32 for every input, so every round, digest, scalar and
candidate is bit-identical. Hit publication still goes through the promoted exact gates, and the
external verifier re-derives every hit on CPU.

## Checks executed

- `build_carrier.sh` (CUDA 12.8.93): image built, 0 stack, 0 spills, the script's symbol and
  `LTC64B` checks passed. The same toolchain reproduces the promoted cubin byte for byte, so it
  matches the runner's.
- Full ranked build through `./setup.sh subset` with the harness's fixed nvcc line: compiled,
  embeds the new image and the knob, CPU verifier smoke test passed.

## Limits

The expected effect is bounded by how much of the kernel's time the FMA-heavy pipe sets. The
moved adds do not disappear: they now compete on the ALU pipe, which the SHA sections already
use heavily. If the chain and SHA phases of different warps overlap well, as the stage-0
rationale of `QSB_SHA_ALU_ADD` assumes, the change is a net gain.
