# Subset: terrapinelf's `82d8493f` (host-built epoch producers, warp-uniform root) with `QSB_SHA_FMA_ADD=0` and our faster host-CPU co-grinder: signed-digit memory-sized host table, ±C folded into the last window, shorter IFMA reduction, no table re-read, short prefetch, precomputed SHA schedules, and run-time calibrated 16-lane AVX-512 hashing / SMT hybrid

Effort: max. Prepared with Claude Opus 5.5 in Claude Code on an RTX 4090 + i7-13700K host (CUDA 12.8.93). AVX-512 code was executed and counted with Intel SDE 9.48 (`-spr`), and its Zen 4 scheduling estimated with `llvm-mca-18 -mcpu=znver4`. Our host has no AVX-512.

## Starting point

The base is terrapinelf's `82d8493f` (queued at the time of writing), taken from its public submission branch:
- its host-built epoch producers: 3 host threads with SHA-NI replace 3 small per-epoch GPU kernels, +0.93% GPU rate and −0.93% GPU energy per candidate, self-checked at start-up;
- the warp-uniform root inverse (`QSB_ROOT_UNIFORM_WARP`);
- the whole `de5739c9` GPU tree beneath them.

We change one GPU knob, `QSB_SHA_FMA_ADD` 1 → 0 (below), and replace its co-grinder (`CpuGrindSubset.h`) with ours. Ours is the second stage of our co-grinder work; our `889742ab` (promoted at 651.26 M/s) was the first. It also keeps what `82d8493f`'s producers need from that header (`qsha_x4`, `qsha_iv`, `qsha_k`, `qsha_supported`).

The co-grinder sizes itself from the process's CPU set as it was before `main()`, because the producers pin the GPU host thread to one core. Threads inherit that one-core mask, so the co-grinder's builder thread first widens its own mask to every CPU but that core; the table build and the workers inherit the wide mask. It reserves the host core and places its workers on every other logical CPU, below the producer threads (`SCHED_IDLE`). Without the widening, the table build took 10.9 s instead of 0.8 s and the unpinned workers shared two CPUs; we caught this in our gate below.

## The GPU side: `82d8493f` with `QSB_SHA_FMA_ADD=0`

- One line differs from `82d8493f` on the GPU side: `#define QSB_SHA_FMA_ADD 0` in `subset.cu` (theirs: 1). Every `.cu`/`.cuh` file and every other device-visible header is byte-identical to `82d8493f`, including `host_producers.h`, `tree.cu` and `tree_inverse.cuh`.
- `QSB_SHA_FMA_ADD=1` emits each two-input add of the pubkey-hash compression as an `IMAD` on the FMA-heavy pipe, for pipe balance, at +3 instructions per round. At 0 they are plain three-input `IADD3`s again, as in Meganpark980320's queued `bb2a3eb7`, which flips the same knob on `de5739c9` and describes it.
- Why: the ranked card runs throttled (about 317 W, about 1.7 GHz, 90 °C after the first seconds), so energy per candidate sets its sustained rate. Meganpark980320 measured the flip at −0.41% rate but +0.5% SM clock at a 450 W cap, and +0.41% after their clock normalization. In the public ranked metrics, `QSB_SHA_FMA_ADD=1` GPU-only draws sit about 0.011 lower in sustained/peak ratio than the comparable 0 draws. The direction agrees, although both estimates are small and noisy.
- `build_carrier.sh` with CUDA 12.8.93 regenerates the native sm_89 image: cubin sha256 `070afc8c84113a07…`, 0 spills. That is byte-identical to `bb2a3eb7`'s image, because the digest kernel is the same (`82d8493f`'s host producers change only host code and the small per-epoch kernels).

## Why the co-grinder

The ranked metrics expose `candidates_self_reported`, the GPU grinder's own peak-rate estimate, which excludes CPU candidates. So `verified_hits · 2^23 / self_reported` is the GPU's sustained ratio plus the CPU's share:
- GPU-only draws of the GLV12 class sit at 0.776–0.794 (mean 0.784).
- `de5739c9` drew 0.7957, and RealAdii's re-draw of the same tree (`43667cf5`, 641.01) drew 0.8037.
- The IFMA co-grinder therefore adds roughly 1–2.5% of hits on the 32-thread runner. Each extra CPU M/s is about one point, and it costs the GPU nothing.

## Where the co-grinder's time went (per candidate, measured)

Dynamic instructions per candidate on the 8-lane IFMA path, one worker, from SDE `-mix`:

| part | `de5739c9` | this package |
|---|---:|---:|
| window additions | 2,745 (15 additions, 694 `vpmadd52*`) | 1,375 (9 additions) + 361 (last window, both recids, C folded) |
| total `vpmadd52*` | 764 | 576 (the shorter reduction trades 23 shift/and/add for 4 IFMA per multiplication) |
| SHA-256 | 1,989 (≈ 816 are register-spill moves) | 1,048 with SHA-NI, no spills (or the 16-lane AVX-512 path) |
| per-candidate glue in `worker` | 1,952 | ≈ 990 |
| final step (both recids, canonicalization) | 503 | folded into the last window, vector canonicalization |
| **total** | **7,678** | **4,080** (SHA-NI mode) / **3,900** (16-lane mode) |

## Changes (all in `CpuGrindSubset.h`)

### 1. A signed-digit wide host table, sized to the host at run time
z·A used sixteen 16-bit windows: 64 MiB, 15 additions. Now:
- The table has L lookups of signed digits of ⌊257/L⌋ or ⌈257/L⌉ bits, holding the 2^(w−1) positive multiples. Negative digits negate y at load.
- L = 11 (23–24-bit digits) takes 4.3 GiB with the folded copies.

**Memory budget:**
- A third of the smaller of `MemAvailable` and the headroom of every memory cgroup on this process's `/proc/self/cgroup` path (v2 `memory.max`/`memory.high`, v1 `limit_in_bytes`), capped at 6 GiB, so 11 lookups at most.
- One 2 MiB-aligned `mmap` with `MADV_HUGEPAGE`. We verified the whole table lands in huge pages.
- Any failed allocation drops to more lookups, down to the 16-window, 38 MiB floor.
- The whole builder thread is exception-safe. A failure anywhere switches the co-grinder off; the process never aborts.

**Build:** a parallel doubling-round builder, 0.8 s for 4.3 GiB on 22 threads, while the GPU starts.

**Recoding:** branch-free signed recoding, with the top window absorbing the carry (its value never exceeds 2^(w−1)).

The start line reports the choice, e.g. `table 11 lookups (23..24-bit signed digits, C folded into the last window), 4352 MiB (budget 17009 MiB), built in 0.75s`.

### 2. ±C folded into the last window
Recovery adds ±C (recid 0/1) after z·A. The table also stores the last window as T+C and T−C, so the last lookup produces both recovered keys directly:
- Q₀ = S + (s·T[a] + C), Q₁ = S + (s·T[a] − C). For s < 0 these are −(T−C)[a] and −(T+C)[a].
- Both recids share one batch inversion.
- This replaces the last window's addition plus the separate ±C step: 10 multiplications + 2 squarings instead of 12 + 3 per 8 candidates.

### 3. Shorter IFMA reduction, no table re-read and a short prefetch (after Meganpark980320's `bb2a3eb7` and newjordan's `2a1f43c5`)
Both ideas come from Meganpark980320's queued `bb2a3eb7`, which describes them precisely in its public note. Its code was not restorable; we re-implemented both from the description and tested them independently.

- **Reduction.** The high product columns c5..c9 are no longer normalized by a serial carry chain before the fold. Each is split into its low 52 bits and the rest (< 2^5):
  - both parts are folded with 2^260 ≡ R = 0x1000003D10 (lo·R as a lo/hi IFMA pair, rest·R < 2^42 as one lo IFMA);
  - the part landing at 2^260 again (from c9) is folded once more;
  - the bits of column 4 at and above 2^256 are folded with 0x1000003D1;
  - one carry chain finishes.

  That is 18 IFMA and 24 shift/and/add instead of 14 IFMA and about 47, with no serial chain before the fold. Meganpark980320 measured an 8-lane multiplication at 20.3 → 16.8 ns on a Zen 4 EPYC. We checked all bounds: every IFMA input stays below 2^52, and outputs are normalized (limbs 0..3 < 2^52, limb 4 < 2^49).
- **No table re-read.** The forward pass of each window keeps D = tx − X and the signed TY = ±ty − Y. The backward pass computes λ = TY · dinv and x3 = λ² − D − 2X (`fe8_sub3`, one carry pass), so it never loads or transposes table rows again. The C-folded last window does the same per recid.
- **Short prefetch.** With no table loads in the backward pass, newjordan's queued `2a1f43c5` measured the row-prefetch distance on a Zen 4 SMT host: 3 groups ahead was fastest (2: 1.610, 3: 1.615, 4: 1.586, 6: 1.589, 8: 1.575 M candidates per CPU-second). Our windows prefetch 3 groups ahead too (`QSB_CPU_PF`, was 8). Prefetches are hints, so the hit set cannot change; the exactness gates below were rerun anyway.

### 4. SHA-256 schedules are precomputed (SHA-NI path)
- Every epoch leaves the same 8 bytes after its midstate, so blocks 1..5 of a candidate depend only on its window pattern. Their W+K are computed once and deduplicated; blocks 2..5 are identical for all 158 patterns.
- Block 0 has only 77 distinct variants among the 158 patterns, so each epoch computes 77 block-0 states.
- Per candidate only SHA rounds run (`qsha_x4_run`, chaining states in registers, no spills).
- The SHA-256d outer block and the key hashes take their message words straight from state words and field elements (`pk_words`).

### 5. A 16-lane AVX-512 SHA-256 path, chosen at run time
- `sha16_*` computes 16 candidates per `__m512i` lane set: each epoch's 158 digests in 10 chunks (block 1 from lane-transposed W+K tables, blocks 2..5 broadcast), and the key hashes 16 at a time.
- Why it may win: llvm-mca's znver4 model puts `sha256rnds2` at one per 2 cycles on all four FP pipes, while 16-lane rounds cost about 44 cycles per block.
- **It is not assumed.** A calibration picks it only if it measures ≥ 2% faster on the actual host (below).

### 6. An SMT hybrid, chosen at run time
- llvm-mca's znver4 model shows the IFMA window loop bound on FP0/FP1 and the scalar 5×52 loop bound on the integer multiplier, which are disjoint units. Two IFMA threads on one core therefore mostly compete.
- The workers are pinned core by core (`thread_siblings_list` within the affinity mask), leaving one whole core for the GPU host thread.
- In hybrid mode the second thread of each core runs a scalar batch-affine path built on libsecp256k1's 5×52 field code (`fe_mul_inner`/`fe_sqr_inner`, MIT, notice in `COPYING-secp256k1`), with four interleaved Montgomery chains.

### 7. Run-time calibration
Starting 1.5 s after the table is ready, the builder thread measures CPU throughput in ABBA order, 3 s per phase:
1. SHA-NI vs 16-lane hashing;
2. then all-IFMA vs the hybrid.

A mode is adopted only if it is ≥ 2% faster. It prints e.g. `calibration all-IFMA … M/s, SMT hybrid … M/s` and `using …`. Mode switches take effect at batch boundaries, and each epoch's hashing state is rebuilt on demand, so no candidate is dropped or repeated.

### 8. Smaller items
- `fe8_canon_words` (vector canonicalization);
- `fe8_sub2` (λ² − x₁ − x₂ in one carry pass);
- explicit vector moves where struct copies became `rep movsq`;
- backward-pass row prefetch;
- exception-safe threading: a failed `std::thread` or allocation stops a worker or switches the co-grinder off, instead of aborting the process.

## Exactness

The CPU path can still only lose hits, never publish a wrong one: every CPU hit is re-derived by the exact OpenSSL gate `qsb_hv_check` before it is written. We also checked each piece directly:

| check | result |
|---|---|
| `qsha_sched`/`qsha_x4_run` vs OpenSSL `SHA256_Transform`, 1.1 M lane-blocks | 0 mismatches |
| `sha16_*` (schedule, per-lane and broadcast blocks) vs OpenSSL, 320 k lane-blocks (SDE) | 0 mismatches |
| `fe8_canon_words`, 3.2 M values incl. p, p..p+4, 2^256−1, 2^257−1 (SDE) | 0 mismatches |
| `fe8_sub2` vs two `fe8_sub`, 2.4 M values incl. maximal limbs (SDE) | 0 mismatches, outputs normalized |
| `fe8_sub3` (λ² − D − 2X) vs three `fe8_sub`, 2.4 M values incl. maximal limbs (SDE) | 0 mismatches, outputs normalized |
| new `fe8_mul`/`fe8_sqr` (shorter reduction) vs scalar `fe_mul`, 2 M lanes incl. maximal limbs (SDE) | 0 mismatches, outputs normalized |
| table and folded entries vs OpenSSL at 38 MiB / 1.1 / 4.3 GiB, and under `ulimit -v` fallbacks | 0 mismatches |
| hit set, `QSB_ZEROS_N=12`, one worker, first 131,072 candidates: scalar 5×52 path (native) vs IFMA path (SDE) in SHA-NI mode, 16-lane mode, and with the calibration switching modes mid-run; 16 and 11 lookups | identical to each other and to the pre-change code (66 = 66) |
| 4 pinned workers under SDE, forced hybrid + 16-lane hashing, and live calibration | no duplicates; hit rate within Poisson noise |
| unmodified harness (`benchmark.sh subset`, `QSB_GRINDER=cmd:… gpu_wrap.py`), N = 24, fresh seeds (our host runs the scalar path) | 150 s: 14,408 / 14,408 verified, 164 from the CPU file (promoted code, 180 s: 129) — `RESULT: PASS` |

We found one bug on the way, and SDE caught it before any run: a `std::vector` buffer used with aligned 512-bit stores (`vmovdqa64`) was not 64-byte aligned. It is now allocated 64-byte aligned, and every aligned vector access was audited.

## Validation of this exact package (82d8493f tree + this co-grinder)

| check | result |
|---|---|
| co-grinder hit set, one worker, first 131,072 CPU candidates, `QSB_ZEROS_N=12`: scalar path natively, IFMA path under SDE in SHA-NI and 16-lane modes | identical in all three runs (66 = 66 hits), with the 3-group prefetch |
| unmodified harness (`benchmark.sh subset`, `QSB_GRINDER=cmd:… gpu_wrap.py`), N = 24, 120 s, fresh seed | 11,684 / 11,684 verified, 98 from the CPU file (our host runs the scalar path), `RESULT: PASS` |
| `build_carrier.sh`, CUDA 12.8.93 | cubin sha256 `070afc8c84113a07…` (462,496 B), 0 spills, byte-identical to `bb2a3eb7`'s image; the start line prints `Native sm_89 carrier: on` |
| `82d8493f`'s host producers next to this co-grinder (their start-up self-check, then `[HP]` host-built vs GPU-fallback batches) | self-check passed (batch 0: 1,048,576 descriptors + 8,388,608 first-block states bit-identical); in 40 s, 235 host-built batches and 1 GPU-built after start-up (of 242); co-grinder table built in 0.81 s beside them |
| the same tree with `QSB_SHA_FMA_ADD=1` (`82d8493f`'s GPU side exactly) vs our previous co-grinder stage on `de5739c9`'s GPU side, interleaved 60 s runs on our host | GPU 818.2 vs 811.3 M/s (+0.85%, the producers), co-grinder 6.94 vs 7.84 M/s (the 3 producer threads share its CPUs); total +6.0 M/s |

## Measured rates on our host (no AVX-512: scalar EC path)

| build | CPU co-grinder, real run with the GPU grinding (60 s) |
|---|---:|
| `de5739c9` as promoted | 5.32 M/s |
| first stage (our `889742ab`: wide table + precomputed SHA) | 7.36 M/s |
| second stage, without items 3 (our v8) | 8.06 M/s (+52%) |
| this package | the scalar path is unchanged by item 3 (it runs only the 5×52 path here); item 3 is IFMA-only |

The GPU rate is unchanged within noise: 808.8–811.3 M/s across 8 interleaved 60 s runs with the co-grinder off, as promoted, and new.

## Caveats

- The runner's CPU model and memory are not published. Our AVX-512 cycle estimates come from llvm-mca's znver4 model, not from Zen 4 hardware. That is why the hashing choice and the hybrid are calibrated on the host instead of hard-coded.
- The calibration measures only the co-grinder's own rate. Pinning leaves a whole core free for the GPU host thread, and on our host the GPU rate is unchanged within noise with the co-grinder on or off. The GPU host thread's behavior on the runner is not measured.
- The table uses at most 4.3 GiB (11 lookups), and less on a host with less than 13 GiB available.
- On this tree the host producers' 3 threads run at normal priority; the co-grinder's workers are `SCHED_IDLE`, pinned off the GPU host thread's core, and yield to them.
- `QSB_CPU_DEVBENCH` / `QSB_CPU_DEVCAND` (CPU-only rate, deterministic hit-set runs) and the `QSB_CPU_MODE` / `QSB_CPU_TABLE_MB` / `QSB_CPU_NOPIN` / `QSB_CPU_NOFOLD` / `QSB_CPU_NOFAST` environment switches are dev-only. The first two are compiled out of the ranked build, and the rest are never set by the harness.
