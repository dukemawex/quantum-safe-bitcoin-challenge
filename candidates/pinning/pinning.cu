 * trips with the two buffers swapping roles: trip term gathers into (x1,y1) with anchor y0,
 * trip term+1 gathers into (x1,y0) with anchor y1. Both trips are the base's gather and
 * _PointAddXYZZ_pair call, statements in the base order, with the same arguments (new ordinate,
 * then anchor). phi runs at the start of a pass: a pass holds terms term and term+1 with term
 * even, and GT_CHUNKS is even, so the base's term == GT_CHUNKS test can only hold on the first
 * trip. After the last pass the current anchor is in y0, where the base's final Load256 leaves
 * it, so the final resolve is unchanged. Every value is bit-identical to the base
 * for every input. 0 leaves the source and PTX unchanged.
 * 2: the same pass with the two trips written out (statements in the base order) and the
 * factors of some products in the other order: the first trip takes R = S2*ZZZ1 + T1*R1,
 * U2 = ZZ1*X2 and PPP = P*PP; the second takes R = ZZZ1*S2 + R1*T1, U2 = ZZ1*X2, PPP = P*PP
 * and V = PP*U2. _ModMultCore and qsb_muladd2_exact reduce the exact product (sum) digits,
 * so the operand order cannot change the bits. Only the register allocation differs;
 * this order builds at 122 registers.

 * Fixed-base table construction on the GPU (shared GLV14 table)
 *
 * Segment zero entry d is (K+d)A, K=333126*2^108-2^17.  Other segments
 * store (2d+1)*2^(shift-1)A.  All are affine little-endian records.
 *
 * Building it on the host would cost a modular inversion per entry through
 * OpenSSL. Split the odd index instead: with m = 2d+1 = hi*256 + lo,
 *
 *     m*base_c = hi*(256*base_c) + lo*base_c = H[hi] + L[lo]
 *
 * so the host only produces two short ladders per chunk (L[lo]=lo*base_c,
 * H[hi]=hi*256*base_c) and every table entry is ONE independent mixed addition
 * plus one inversion -- perfectly parallel, one inversion per thread.
 *
 * For segment zero L[lo]=(K+lo)A and m=d; elsewhere L[lo]=lo*base and
 * m=2d+1.  H[hi]=hi*256*base in both cases.
